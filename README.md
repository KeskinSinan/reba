## REBA Calculator For Our University Capstone Project!
This calculator analyzes employee postures and helps to perform risk analysis and REBA score calculation.

The usage scenario is as follows.

The course code and section number sections on the first page are designed in a way that Bahçeşehir University students can enter. To use the system:

Course Code : test

Section Number: 123

You can use the information above.


With the page that opens, you will see some options where you can calculate the REBA score. You can calculate by uploading a video to the system, using the default video in the system, or without uploading any video to the system.


That's it! The rest is up to your ergonomic knowledge and choices.
